# Store project DANMA

This work was for a Coderhouse React course. It's intended to be a mate shop (traditional drink from Argentina) for a married couple, it shows the products at the front page for easy access and has various links that are direct in their purpose (such as Â¿Como comprar? = How do I buy?)

## Select a product and add to cart 
The items are uploaded to firebase and can be dynamically updated. The cart widget will display the number of items inside it.

## Display cart items
After adding items to the cart, you can either choose "Terminar compra" (meaning finish your purchase) or directly click the cart widget to be redirected to the cart page, there if you wish to empty it just choose "Eliminar producto" (Remove item) or "Vaciar Carrito" (Empty cart). A button then will redirect you to the main page for you to choose other products if you wish.

## Filter between categories
It is possible to add a category to an item to filter it. In this case, I chose to filter between "Novedades" (New products) or Bombillas, but the category can be whatever the developer wishes.

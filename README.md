# Store project DANMA

This work was for a Coderhouse React course. It's intended to be a mate shop (traditional drink from Argentina) for a married couple, it shows the products at the front page for easy access and has various links that are direct in their purpose (such as Â¿Como comprar? = How do I buy?)
